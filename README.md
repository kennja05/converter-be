    In order to make use of a currency conversion API which I paid $10 for access for the rest of the month of April 2020, I am creating this application to explore concepts in currency conversion and data visualization

Steps: 

    1) Clone down the repo, and run the command 'cd converter-be'
    2) Run the following 4 commands
        i) 'rails db:create'
        ii) 'rails db:migrate'
        iii) 'rails db:seed'
        iiii) 'rails s'
    3) Locate the front end repo and follow the steps there to complete set up
